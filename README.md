# About

This is an ALX Software Engineer (SWE) project, a clone of AirBnB (https://www.airbnb.com/). This is the first step towards building your first full web application. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

The console is a command enterpreter to manage object abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

The console will:

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* create new objects
* retrieve an object from a file
* do operations on objects
* destroy a file/object

# Storage

All classes will be handled by 'Storage' engine in the 'FileStorage' class.
